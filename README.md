# ThriveBand
This is a submission to HogHacks 2024. Our project is a novel device that tracks sweat-glucose levels, and predicts crampage in muscles through a novel encoder-decoder LSTM neural network. This device also helps monitor marathon pacing through gyroscope calculations.

Electrolyte.ipynb shows the Encoder-Decoder neural network, which forecasts future liklihoods of muscle cramps from sweat glucose/electrolyte readings, and ThriveBand_Arduino_Script.ino is our C++ machine code that implements gyroscope logic and ML implementations.
